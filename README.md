## Why?

There are tons of boilerplate projects already out there, then why one more?
Most of them are too bloated or too complex for simple applications or few react newbies. I have tried to create a boilerplate which is good enough for developing high performance production applications, at the same time maintaining the simplicity.

> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and good for even beginners**!


## Features

This boilerplate features all the latest tools and practices in the industry.

- _React.js_ - **React 16**✨, React Router 5
- _Redux.js_ - Redux saga, Redux immutable and Reselect
- _Babel_ - ES6, ESNext, Airbnb and React/Recommended config
- _Webpack_ - **Webpack 4**✨, Hot Reloading, Code Splitting, Optimized Prod Build and more
- _Test_ - Jest with Enzyme
- _Lint_ - ESlint
- _Styles_ - SCSS Styling

Here are a few highlights to look out for in this boilerplate 

<dl>
  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more, today.</dd>

  <dt>Component Specific Styles</dt>
  <dd>Separate styles for each component. Style in the good old scss way but still keep it abstracted for each component.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>SEO</dt>
  <dd>We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)</dd>
</dl>

But wait... there's more!

  - *The best test setup:* Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
    changes. (Seen a react app with 99% test coverage before?)
  - *The fastest fonts:* Say goodbye to vacant text.
  - *Stay fast*: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
    line!
  - *Catch problems:* TravisCI setup included by default, so your
    tests get run automatically on each code push.

## Info

This boilerplate is derived from [react-redux-boilerplate](https://github.com/flexdinesh/react-redux-boilerplate.git)
Kudos to Dinesh for creating this boilerplate. I have removed and added few things on top of his setup. I needed a boilerplate for react which was very simple and convinient without too much of bloat.
